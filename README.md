# Solhack_dapp
A web app for creators to get USDC tips on Solana. It generates a QR code or link (Blink) that lets users send tips directly from wallets like Phantomâ€”no dApp needed. Powered by Solana Actions for transactions, Blinks for sharing, Solana Pay for payments, and Helius APIs for blockchain data.
